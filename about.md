Hi, my name is J&uuml;rgen Cito, and I'm a software engineer and CS grad student at <a href="http://www.informatik.tuwien.ac.at">Vienna University of Technology</a>, writing my thesis on 'Statistics in Web Performance' (working title) at the <a href="http://www.infosys.tuwien.ac.at/">Distributed Systems Group</a> in collaboration with <a href="http://www.catchpoint.com">Catchpoint Systems</a> where I'm currently conducting research in New York City. 

I'm also a teaching assistant for various classes, next semester (probably the last time) for Advanced Software Engineering, Functional Programming and Database Systems.

Mostly I'm using Java/Ruby (Rails or Sinatra) for software development. Currently I'm in love with Haskell, but unfortunately can't find the time to actually practice it.

In my freetime I enjoy playing football, travelling all around the world (especially Europe and US), and listening to some good <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/1120911358">music</a>.
