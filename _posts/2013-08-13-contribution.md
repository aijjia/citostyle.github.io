In order for me to even consider starting to publish anything online (I hate the word blog), I had to ask myself 'What can I bring to the table?'. In a world of information overflow, I contemplated what could be a worthy contribution on my part to not partake in the senseless adding of information that nobody is really interested in.

A few things came to mind, that might offer some insight and value:

* Experiences working abroad (cultures, travel, dealing with bureaucracy, etc.)
* Software Engineering vs. Consulting, career options for CS majors
* Academic Teaching and Tutoring
* ... maybe more?

I will extend this post later, when I have some more time. (Oh boy, time's actually a good topic).
